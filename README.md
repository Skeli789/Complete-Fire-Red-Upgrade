###### Notes :
- To expand the amount of items just change the number in the file "bytereplacement" to the amount you want +1.
Ex: 800 items +1 in hex will be 0x321.
Change word to new number of items for "21 03"
- It is advised to use [DPE-gen-9](https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/Dynamic-Pokemon-Expansion-Gen-9) with it.
- If you want to see how potential this expansion would have in future read [this](https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/CFRU-expansion/blob/Experiments/todo.md)
- Please don't try to use leon rombase on it as it already contains items + more
